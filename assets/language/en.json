"faqq1":"1. What is a Mobile Mechanic?",
"faqa1":"A Mobile Mechanic will normally come to your house, roadside, or place of work with the parts, and the tools they need to fix or service your car then and there. Our team of mobile mechanics will meet you at your door!",
"diveinto":"Dive into our FAQs to find answers to all your car ownership questions!",
"faqq2":"2. Why should I change my engine oil and filter every 3 months or 3,000 miles?",
"faqa2":"Engine oil not only loses its lubrication quality or viscosity over time, but it also collects acids and other by-products of combustion such as water. These substances are enemies of bearings, other metal surfaces, seals, and gaskets. Even though oils are continuing to increase in lubrication quality, the substances in suspension are damaging to the internal engine components.",
"faqa2a":"Changing oil and filter on a 3-month or 3,000-mile schedule is “good insurance” against the possible damage that can occur. If the facility that is performing the oil change is inspecting the vehicle properly, you will save money by identifying a need before it becomes an emergency. It is always wise to make sure a certified technician is handling your vehicle.",
"faqq3":"3. Why should I have my belts and hoses replaced?",
"faqcard1":"Anyone who has ever dabbled in DIY auto repair can tell you: you’re probably going to have some questions (and say some swear words) along the way.",
"faqcard2":"Our family has been in the automotive business for a long time, and, throughout the years, we’ve noticed that customers often have questions about the same things. To save you time and make us look smart, we created this all-in-one resource filled with answers to the most common questions we hear or have dealt with ourselves.",
"faqcard3":"Read on for helpful tips and tutorials from our team of automotive experts on everything from the dreaded check engine light to brakes, DIY oil changes, wipers, batteries, changing your tires, and more. There are no stupid questions. There are, however, bad DIY jobs—and we would like it if your car didn’t blow up.",

Replacing worn hoses reduces the chance of failure that could cause engine overheating, and allows for testing of the coolant.",
